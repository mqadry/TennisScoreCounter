# Tennis-Score-Counter
The scope of this project was to create a scoring system for Tennis game as an example project required by the free online course on Udacity, "Android Basics: User Input, Lesson 4: Score Keeper App".

The layout of the app should look like the below image. Words written in black font are the Views ID.

This app has a bug that need to be fixed. When completing the game at Full Score (using the 5 groups), the app is halted due to unhandled exception.
